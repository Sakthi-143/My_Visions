# Data Collection and Cleaning 

## Overview

This project focuses on collecting raw data from diverse sources and cleaning it to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. Effective data collection and cleaning are critical steps in any data science or machine learning project, as the quality of the data directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses and models. üìä‚ú®

## Introduction

Data collection involves gathering raw data from various sources such as databases, APIs, web scraping, or manual entry. Once collected, the data requires cleaning and preprocessing to address issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, errors, and duplicates. üìùüîç

## Data Collection

In this section, we outline the methods and tools used for data collection:

- **Source**: Describe the sources from which data was collected.
- **Tools**: List the tools or technologies used for data collection.
- **Process**: Provide a step-by-step overview of the data collection process, including any scripts or workflows used. üõ†Ô∏èüåê

Example:

```markdown
### Source
- Publicly available datasets from Kaggle
- Twitter API for real-time social media data

### Tools
- Python (requests, BeautifulSoup) for web scraping
- Tweepy for accessing Twitter API

### Process
1. Identify relevant datasets and sources.
2. Develop scripts for web scraping and API access.
3. Retrieve data from sources and store it locally.
```

## Data Cleaning

In this section, we discuss the techniques and procedures used for data cleaning:

- **Data Quality Assessment**: Assess the quality of the collected data and identify any issues.
- **Cleaning Procedures**: Detail the steps taken to clean the data, such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and resolving inconsistencies.
- **Validation**: Describe how the cleaned data was validated to ensure its integrity and suitability for analysis. üßπüßº

Example:

```markdown
### Data Quality Assessment
- Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Identify and document data quality issues.

### Cleaning Procedures
1. Handle missing values: imputation, removal, or interpolation.
2. Remove duplicate records.
3. Standardize data formats and units.
4. Resolve inconsistencies and errors.

### Validation
- Perform sanity checks and cross-validation to verify data integrity.
```

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the cleaned data or incorporate the data collection and cleaning processes into other projects.

Example:

```markdown
To use the cleaned data in your analysis:
1. Download the dataset from the provided link.
2. Load the data into your preferred analysis environment (e.g., Python, R).
3. Follow the data cleaning procedures outlined in this README to ensure data integrity.
```


## Tools Overview

The following are the tools that are covered in Complete Machine Learning Package. They are popular tools that most machine learning engineers and data scientists need in one way or another and day to day. 

* [Python](https://www.python.org) is a high level programming language that has got a lot of popularity in the data community and with the rapid growth of the libraries and frameworks, this is a right programming language to do ML.

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org) is a scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations. 

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is a great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) is a comprehensive data visualization tool used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) is another data visualization tool built on top of Matplotlib which is pretty simple to use.

* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Instead of building machine learning models from scratch, Scikit-Learn makes it easy to use classical models in a few lines of code. This tool is adapted by almost the whole of the ML community and industries, from the startups to the big techs. 

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and [Keras](https://keras.io) for deep learning: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Keras is a high level neural network API that makes it easy to design deep learning models. TensorFlow and Keras have a great [community](https://discuss.tensorflow.org) and ecosystem that include tools like [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), [TF Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite), [TensorFlow Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/), [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub), [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), [TensorFlow GNN](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn), and [much](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets) [more](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/tools).
